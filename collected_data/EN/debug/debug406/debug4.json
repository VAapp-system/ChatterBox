The better the cut grade, the better the sparkle and the more light is returned out of the top of the diamond. If the diamond is cut too shallow or too deep, it would sparkle less as the light leaks out the bottom or out of the sides. That's why you really want an ideal cut diamond, no compromise here! What shall we cover next: shapes, color, clarity or carat?",
