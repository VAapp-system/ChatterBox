He is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time, developing new laws of mechanics, gravity and laws of motion. His work  Principia Mathematica (1687) laid the framework for the Scientific Revolution of the Seventeenth Century. A great polymath, Newton’s investigations also included areas of optics, religion and alchemy.\nEarly Life of Newton\nSir Isaac Newton was born on Christmas Day, in 1643, to a relatively poor farming family. His father died three months before he was born. His mother later remarried, but her second husband did not get on with Isaac; leading to friction between Isaac and his parents. The young Isaac attended school at King’s School, Grantham in Lincolnshire (where his signature is still inscribed on the walls.) Isaac was one of the top students, but before completing his studies his mother withdrew him from school, so Isaac could work as a farmer. It was only through the intervention of the headmaster that Isaac was able to return to finish his studies; he passed his final exams with very good results and was able to go to Trinity College, Cambridge.",
