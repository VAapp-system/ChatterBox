She thinks the creature must be enormous to have made such a big mess. But look! There's a patch of mud by the wash line with a hoofprint in it. That print doesn't look very big to me. Hmmm...\nMaybe we should go to the village square to see if anyone there saw anything. I'm sure Monsieur LePain, the baker, will know something. Or we can find Monsieur Marchand at his fruit cart.\nWho do you think we should talk to next? The baker or the fruit seller?",
