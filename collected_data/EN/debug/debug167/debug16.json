I went to bed that night feeling very proud - and very tired. Just as I was about to blow out my candle, I heard a light tap on my door. It was Chip. \"Hello,\" I said, surprised. \"Why aren't you in bed?\" Chip explained that he couldn't sleep, and wondered if there was a book that might help him.

I opened the cover and began to read softly. \"Once upon a time, in a faraway land . . .\" Soon, Chip's eyelids were drooping. I quietly closed the book and carried him back to the cupboard. I'd been right. There was nothing a book - and a friend - couldn't fix. The end.\nI've so enjoyed spending time with you today. I hope that you'll visit again very soon. Goodbye.",
