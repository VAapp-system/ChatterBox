                    "formattedText": "The brain is made up of many specialized areas that work together:\n• The cortex is the outermost layer of brain cells. Thinking and voluntary movements begin in the cortex.\n• The brain stem is between the spinal cord and the rest of the brain. Basic functions like breathing and sleep are controlled here.\n• The basal ganglia are a cluster of structures in the center of the brain. The basal ganglia coordinate messages between multiple other brain areas.\n• The cerebellum is at the base and the back of the brain. The cerebellum is responsible for coordination and balance.\n\nThe brain is also divided into several lobes:\n• The frontal lobes are responsible for problem solving and judgment and motor function.\n• The parietal lobes manage sensation, handwriting, and body position.\n• The temporal lobes are involved with memory and hearing.\n• The occipital lobes contain the brain's visual processing system.\n\nThe Nervous System\nThe nervous system is commonly divided into the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. The central nervous system is made up of the brain, its cranial nerves and the spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system is composed of the spinal nerves that branch from the spinal cord and the autonomous nervous system (divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system).",
