Cook over medium-medium high heat for 1 minute, stirring constantly. When I cook mine it comes to a boil and gets thick pretty quickly.\nRemove from heat. Stir in powdered sugar. Instead of stirring with a spoon you can use and electric mixure.\nIf fudge is too dry and firm you can add an additional teaspoon of milk, then mix again. If it's still too firm add another teaspoon of milk. Repeat until you get the consistency you want. Remember though, it will get firmer as it sets in the fridge.\nPress into prepared pan.\nDust with powdered sugar, if desired.\nRefrigerate for a few hours. Cut into 1\" pieces.
