Call RediCare VIP Telemedicine first.\nUnlike an abrasion (a wound caused by friction or scraping), none of the skin is missing, the skin is just separated. A cut is typically thought of as a wound caused by a sharp object (such as a knife or a shard of glass). The term laceration implies a torn or jagged wound. Cuts and Lacerations up to 4 inches (10 cm) are covered at Urgent Care facilities unless on the face. The face usually requires plastic surgery and for those you must go to an Emergency Room and it is not covered by RediCare VIP",
