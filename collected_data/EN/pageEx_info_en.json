If you want to set your water care in the “away from home” mode, before heading out for vacation, simply say, “OK Google, talk to in.touch 2” and then “set my water care to away from home.” You have to use your existing login and password from your mobile app to control your spa with Google Home.Google Home actions will improve in the future.

A hero who will get to the bottom of things and report back to the king. But who will undertake such a dangerous mission? Why you!Welcome to the tranquil village of Stoneville, home to a monastery of the mysterious order and currently severely troubled by bandits. Or at least that's how it appears. But it is soon revealed that things are not as they seem. For some answers, one has to look far into the past.That's how your long, adventurous, and at times hilarious journey begins. You'll meet friends and foes, solve puzzles, fight courageous battles, and discover secrets from times past. It surely will be a challenging adventure for a lone hero.Fortunately, you won't be going alone on this adventure! You'll have a loyal companion at your side, one who'll guide your decisions and help you through difficult times. You'll undoubtedly love her! Or maybe now. She might just drive you crazy.The Iron Falcon is an interactive audio story suitable for both beginners as well as seasoned players of classic gamebooks. It's an audio game that's easy to learn and offers plenty of choices along the way as well as entertaining features such as random encounters, hidden plot options, devious puzzles, and multiple endings. It is also a tongue-in-cheek homage to our favorite gamebooks of yesteryears, particularly Lone Wolf by Joe Denver. We hope you enjoy playing it as much as we did creating it!The Iron Falcon was created with TWIST, our very own interactive storytelling tool for Voice. With TWIST, anyone can easily create interactive Voice stories using a flowchart-like, visual, codeless interface.

        "Description": "Indiagate offers you to know some amazing facts about India Gate like ,     India Gate is one of the largest war memorials in India. The monument was designed by Edwin Lutyens, the chief architect of New Delhi. The foundation stone of India Gate was laid by the Duke of Connaught, on 10th February 1921. It took approximately 10 years to complete the construction work on the monument, which came to an end in 1931. The walls of India Gate have been inscribed with the names of the Indian soldiers who died in World War I and the Afghan Wars. The monument rises to a height of 42 meters and has many important roads spreading out from it. The arch of India Gate houses a shrine, inside which is the ever-burning Amar Jawan Jyoti. Amar Jawan Jyoti was unveiled on January 26, 1972, by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The flame of the Jyoti burns day and night, to remind the nation of soldiers who died in the Indo-Pakistan War of December 1971. The shrine has a black marble cenotaph with a rifle placed on its barrel, crested by a soldier’s helmet. It is customary for the President and the Prime Minister, as well as visiting Guests of State, to pay homage at Amar Jawan Jyoti, on ceremonial state occasions. India Gate stands surrounded by lush, green gardens and is flanked by the clean waters of a lake. India Gate serves as the venue of the Republic Day parade, which takes place on 26th January every year.",

His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica(\"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\"), first published in 1687, laid the foundations of classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus.

Whether it’s a hotel renovation, or a small bathroom remodel or a DIY project, we bring you the inside outlook you need on all things interior & design. I am your host Staci Greenberg. I am also an interior designer. I have spent many years speaking with the various trades and people associated with building projects of all sizes. I have talked with everyone from architects & contractors to fabric manufacturers & furniture makers, as well as many of the various craftspeople who create beautiful and interesting pieces just waiting to be used in your design project. I ask the questions the consumer wants to know such as how does the furniture maker select which wood or material to use? What are the differences between factory-made and handmade furniture? What kind of wallcovering is right for your project: paint or wallpaper? You will learn the information you need to know when making those all-important decisions on material selections or whom to work with on your project.You are welcome to email your questions via the website https://interioranddesignllc.com/.Post questions or comments at https://www.facebook.com/interioranddesignllc/ or at https://www.instagram.com/ianddllc/Tweet us at https://twitter.com/ianddllc and we will make sure to address it in the next show.

Eric got his foot in the door with Ted Turner's organization as a \"C-Team Announcer\" and a few short years later, he was President of World Championship Wrestling. Eric signed Hulk Hogan, turned a profit for the company for the very first time, started Monday Night Nitro, created the nWo, and beat Vince McMahon's Monday Night RAW head-to-head in Monday Night Wars 83 consecutive times. 83 Weeks will take a deep dive into the highs and lows of Eric Bischoff's unparalleled successes in the wrestling business.

The app tries to find the name of the new color formed, but if it does not find any, then it will return the name of the color closest to it.

        "Description": "\"This Day In Weather History\" is a daily podcast by The Weather Network that features unique and informative stories from host Chris Mei.  Weather Happens Everyday.  It can be sunny, cloudy, stormy or maybe just unsettled, but it is always happening!  It’s when severe weather strikes that it captures the attention of those affected ...and the imagination of everyone else who follows the story.  So it is with good reason to expect that after over a century of news and weather information gathering and record keeping, there would be a \"special\" weather or natural phenomena event to mark each day of a calendar.  Do you remember the first recorded tornado in Canadian history? No, you don’t because none of us were there...so we dive into that!  How about when Prince played the Super Bowl halftime show?  It’s possible the best performance ever for that event….and the backstory made it all the more special!  Or how about the 25th Anniversary Woodstock Festival back in 1994? Bands like Green Day and Nine Inch Nails were only 2 albums into their young careers, but how they adapted to the weather conditions is what instantly made their performances not only legendary, but also catapulted them into mainstream stardom. It’s all here - all year - in one podcast.... \"This Day In Weather History\"!",
