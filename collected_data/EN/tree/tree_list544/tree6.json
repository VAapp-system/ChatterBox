Tweet Storms are a series of linked tweets normally composed by a user replying to his or her own tweets. By letting users compose one long rant within a single screen, Twitter is essentially eliminating the character limit on their platform. While this feature is only in beta, it is expected to be rolled out widely. To hear this week's second story, say Tell Me Another.",
