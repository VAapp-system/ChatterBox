He's sure the creature must be quite menacing if it stole such a sweet, innocent, little goat. Oh, but look! There's a hole under the gate to Genevieve's pen. Surely a ferocious monster could have just ripped down the fence. I'd say that gives us another piece of the puzzle...\nI think I might know what the creature is, but I'm not absolutely sure. Let's go over the clues we've gathered.\nThere's the tiny hoofprint in the mud in Madame Dubois' yard.\nAnd then, there's the small bitemarks in Monsieur LePain's pie.\nFinally, there's the hole under the gate to Genevieve's pen.\nHave you figured out who the monster really is?",
