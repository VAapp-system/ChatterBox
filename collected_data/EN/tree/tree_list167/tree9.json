He thinks a creature with an appetite that big must be gigantic. Oh, but that's odd. There's a half eaten pie on the ground and the bites look pretty small to me. How interesting...\nNow, let's keep looking for clues. There are a lot of people gathered at the tavern who might know something, but we could also find some information by talking to Farmer Florent.\nWhere should we go next? The tavern or the farm?",
