North Goa is a place full of crowded beaches, beach shacks, huge franchise restaurants and a great nightlife area. Whereas South Goa is a more peaceful destination with never ending clean beaches , Bird Sanctuaries, Wildlife areas, good restaurants, and highly luxurious hotels and resorts on the beaches as well as the scenic backwaters.Do you want to explore more?",
