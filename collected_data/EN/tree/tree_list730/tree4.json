Overall, I would give our Fourth of July weekend a 10 out of 10!    Conditions will remain dry to kick off our upcoming work week. The heat and humidity will return as highs range from 88-94 degrees Monday and Tuesday. Moisture will increase . Say \"read news\" to continue reading. For weather say \"play weather\". For headlines say \"play headlines\".",
