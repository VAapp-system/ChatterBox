One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 500 million active users.FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. 100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. POWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.For those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.",

For example, VIJAC Scheduler will recognize and record 'Legal Process Lectures from September 12th to December 1st every Friday at 10:30am and 2:30pm except November 4th to November 12th' as one calendar event. VIJAC Scheduler supports complex scheduling statements with MONTLY, WEEKLY, DAILY and ANNUALLY repetitions.

Have different pre-set weeks.★Block list feature: Select in each profile which callers are going to be allowed. Never get awake in the middle of the night for an unwanted call, but be always ready for your kids, wife or husband. ★Tasks and Events:-Activate profile \"Car\" when \"my car\" bluetooth is connected-Activate profile \"Home\" when \"my home WIFI\" is detected-Activate profile Job when getting close to your job ★Autodialing:-Activate your voicemail in a profile and deactivate in another.-Activate call forwarding★Automation apps:Let other automation apps (like Tasker, AutomateIt, Macrodroid...) to activate the profiles created in SoundProfile.★Google Calendar:Activate profiles or change the week scheduler depending on your Google Calendar events or reminders.This app is not free.

        "Description": "「音声メモ帳」では、最大6件の音声メモの記録、再生、削除ができます。ガイダンスのあとに、番号指定なしで、メッセージの記録や再生や消去ができるメモの領域が１つ用意してあり、手軽に利用できます。また、ガイダンスのあとに、１番目から５番目のメモの番号を指定すると、それぞれの番号に移り、そこでのメッセージの記録や再生や消去を行うというのが、基本的な利用方法です。これらの６つのメモの領域を上手に使って、手が離せないシチュエーションでの個人での簡易な音声メモや、ホームスピーカーでの家族間のメッセージのやり取りなど、利用方法の工夫をしてみてください。また、ガイダンスにこれらの利用方法の内容が含まれていますが、ガイダンスをスキップし、直ぐに利用することも可能となっています。ガイダンス後の具体的な利用方法は、最初に、１番目から５番目のメモの番号を指定し、それぞれの番号に移った直後にメッセージを言うと、自動的に音声認識してテキスト記録がなされます。認識したテキストは、すぐに自動再生しますので、誤認識された場合はもう一度メッセージを上書き記録してください。（”削除”のあと、再度メッセージを言っても同じですが、ひと手間省けます）なお、メモが記録されていなければ、その旨をアナウンスします。また、それぞれのメモの番号に移ったあと、違う番号を言うと、その番号に移っていきますので、１～５番のメモをそれぞれ確認することができます。（番号無しメモには移れませんので、悪しからずご了承ください。再度確認したい場合は、お手数ですが、いったんアプリを終了して、再度「音声メモ帳」を呼び出してください。）不具合、改善要望などありましたら、コメント欄にお願いします。2019.5.13 | version 1.1",
